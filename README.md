This repository demonstrates a common error encountered in Node.js development: the 'port already in use' error. The `bug.js` file contains code that attempts to start an HTTP server on port 8080. If this port is already occupied by another process, the server will fail to start. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution to handle this scenario gracefully.
